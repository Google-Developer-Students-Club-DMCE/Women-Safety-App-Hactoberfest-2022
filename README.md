## Introduction 
In today's world, people using smart phones have increased rapidly and hence, a smart phone can be used efficiently for personal security or various other protection purposes. The heinous incident that outraged the entire nation have waken us to go for the safety issues and so a host of new apps have been developed to provide security systems to women via their phones. An Android Application for the Safety of Women and the app can be activated by a single click, whenever need arises. A single click on this app identifies the location of place through GPS and sends a message comprising this location URL to the registered contacts and also call on the first registered contact to help the one in dangerous situations. The unique feature of this application is to send the message to the registered contacts continuously for every five minutes until the “stop” button in the application is clicked. Continuous location tracking information via SMS helps to find the location of the victim quickly and can be rescued safely.

## Existing System
  
There are very limited number of applications for women protection when they are in dangerous situation.According to the statistics, it is found that every two out of three women have suffered trauma in the last year. According to the survey of women, it is found that women are losing their confidence because of such incidents. In situations, they have to call out for help for people nearby or have to call the contacts but with areas of no network connectivity this becomes an issue.
